# Meta Invests $14.8 Billion in Scale AI, Hires CEO Alexandr Wang

**CNBC | June 10, 2025**

In a stunning move that reshapes the AI landscape, Meta has agreed to invest $14.8 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, while simultaneously hiring the company's 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new "superintelligence" division at Meta. The deal values Scale AI at $30 billion, more than doubling its previous $13.8 billion valuation.

## Deal Structure

- **Meta investment:** $14.8 billion for 49% stake
- **Scale AI valuation:** $30 billion
- **Executive hire:** CEO Alexandr Wang joins Meta
- **Strategic focus:** AGI development and data infrastructure

## Background on Scale AI

Scale AI, founded in 2016, became the leading provider of training data for AI models, serving clients including:
- OpenAI (for GPT model training)
- Google (for LaMDA and Gemini development)
- Tesla (for autonomous vehicle systems)
- U.S. Department of Defense (for various AI initiatives)

The company's revenue grew 500% to $750 million in 2024, with 85% gross margins on data labeling and annotation services.

## Strategic Rationale

Mark Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's AI standing drove the aggressive move. Sources close to the CEO indicate disappointment with:
- Llama 4's poor reception among developers
- Continued lag behind OpenAI in model capabilities
- Limited enterprise adoption of Meta's AI products

Zuckerberg stated: "Alexandr and his team have built the infrastructure that powers every major AI breakthrough. Bringing this capability in-house positions Meta to lead the next phase of AI development."

## Industry Disruption

The acquisition forces major competitors to sever relationships with Scale AI:
- **Google:** Terminated $200 million annual contract, citing competitive conflicts
- **Microsoft:** Ended Azure partnership discussions
- **OpenAI:** Evaluating alternative data providers

Wang's departure creates significant disruption at Scale AI, where he maintained direct relationships with major customers and drove product vision.

## Alexandr Wang Profile

At 28, Wang becomes one of tech's youngest senior executives:
- MIT dropout who founded Scale AI at age 19
- Forbes 30 Under 30 recipient (2018)
- Net worth estimated at $2.4 billion pre-Meta deal
- Known for data-centric approach to AI development

## Meta's AI Strategy

The Scale AI integration supports Meta's broader AI initiatives:
- **Reality Labs:** Enhanced training data for metaverse applications
- **Instagram/Facebook:** Improved content recommendation algorithms
- **WhatsApp:** Advanced conversational AI capabilities
- **Enterprise AI:** New B2B products leveraging Scale's infrastructure

## Market Reaction

Meta stock rose 7.2% on the announcement, as investors viewed the move as addressing key AI competitive gaps. Analysts noted:

*"This acquisition gives Meta the data infrastructure muscle it needs to compete with OpenAI and Google. Wang's track record speaks for itself."* - Goldman Sachs

*"The price tag is massive, but Meta's AI efforts needed this level of commitment to remain relevant."* - Morgan Stanley

## Competitive Response

Industry reactions highlight the strategic significance:
- **OpenAI:** Accelerating partnerships with alternative data providers
- **Google:** Increasing investment in internal data operations
- **Amazon:** Exploring acquisitions in the data labeling space

The move signals that AI competition is entering a new phase focused on data infrastructure and talent acquisition rather than just model development.
